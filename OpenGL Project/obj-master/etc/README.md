# OBJ Example

This example demonstrates the display of a model using the [OBJ C](https://github.com/rlk/obj) module.

-	Left mouse button pans and tilts the camera
-	Right mouse button moves the light source
-	W A S D move the camera

This code conforms to the OpenGL 3.2 Core Profile and demonstrates diffuse, specular, and normal mapping. Normal map support is a non-standard extension to the MTL specification.

The example uses [SDL2](http://www.libsdl.org) for window management, with [GLFundamentals.hpp and GLDemonstration.hpp](https://github.com/rlk/GLFundamentals) for OpenGL state handling and interaction.
